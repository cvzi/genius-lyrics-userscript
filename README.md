# genius-lyrics-userscript

A userscript library to show lyrics from [genius.com](https://genius.com/) on other websites

It's primarily designed for Firefox with [Tampermonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/) and Chrome with [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).

This **DOES NOT** work with Greasemonkey because of [this bug greasemonkey/issues/2574](https://github.com/greasemonkey/greasemonkey/issues/2574) in Greasemonkey.
